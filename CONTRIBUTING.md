## Requirements

Feel free to fork and improve the code! There are some things I would like
before I merge your pull request.

1. Make sure your code is clean, sensible, and well-documented.
2. If you're pushing public methods, make sure appropriate tests are also
   provided.
3. I don't expect your code to throw up zero Rubocop warnings, but it's there
   for a reason!
